```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
set.seed(0)
```

```{r}
df = read.csv("data/covertype.csv")
head(df)
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

All values are observed to be numerically encoded thus no cleaning is required

```{r}
summary(df)
```
All distributions except Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology contain expected values. These values may be correct however further validation is required.

```{r}
df$Cover_Type = as.factor(df$Cover_Type)

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology, fill = Cover_Type)) + geom_density(alpha=0.3)
```
Observing the actual distributions of Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology by Cover_Type appears to indicate that there is a defined directionality of measure therefore these values are valid.

```{r}
# Checking for missing values
sum(is.na(df))
```
